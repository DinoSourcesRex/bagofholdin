Vaguely pyramidal shaped woody bushes with profuse foliage bear clusters of small, fragrant yellow blooms which eventually give way to fiery peppers of a marbled red-orange. The bushes bloom continually in the tropical climes of the Swordfish Islands causing Cachuga bushes to produce large numbers of these fire peppers. The peppers themselves are 2-4 inches long and hang from the bushes by thick, green, vein-like structures. Cachuga Peppers are exceptionally spicy and flavorful, and the skin of these peppers is leathery and can be mashed into a paste, then shaped and dried into chips or a flavorful yet non-spicy paper-like wrapping, pairing nicely with raw fish. The peppers dry well, retaining their fire and flavor for exceptional periods of time, and their seeds can be ground into a powder that causes *severe* eye and skin irritation (DC 16 Cons. Save or blindness for 2d10 minutes).',

Numerous cream-colored spheres, 10' in diameter, that cling to the branches are the source of the tree's name.

The globes are filled with a viscous, sticky mucus and burst on contact, causing creatures hit with them to stick to the Dripping Tree's root clusters (DC 18 Dexterity or Strength Save to avoid grapple). When pressure is constantly applied to an area of roots, the branches above it begin to slowly drip a sticky, acidic, digestive mucus onto the area below (1d6-1 acid damage per hour). This mucus melts through flesh and bones like butter.

When the liquid has cooled, the infusion should then be drunk in order to relieve status effects temporarily (3d4 hours).

The inside of the fruit is a shade of golden yellow, and is quite sweet. Eating the fruit restores hit points equal to two of your hit dice and restores any expended hit dice from short rests.',

However, they will also render the eater mute for 20 minutes for each berry eaten. Also, if more than 5 or 6 berries are eaten at a time, a saving throw vs poison is required to avoid severe stomach cramps.

Some believe the weed to have been magically created, as it grows from seed to mature adult in a matter of days, often seeming to appear instantaneously. Once the weed reaches maturity, it produces a small cluster of white flowers. The petals of the flowers are coated with a dusty powder that causes a slight rash if it comes into contact with the skin. These petals are some'times picked to create Itching Powder (When coming into contact with bare flesh, the victim must make a Cons'titut'ion saving throw, DC 13, or begin itching for the next 2d4 hours, or un'til the powder is washed off.). The rapidly growing weed is said to overcome crops nearly overnight, choking out carefully planted fields, and destroying months of work. Most livestock also refuse to eat the weed, with the except'ion of goats. Thus, many farmers that live in areas where Thalsen Weed thrives also keep a small number of goats that they let wander in the outer edges of their lands.",

A shallow and spreading root system robs nearby plants of food and moisture causing these trees to be found with few neighbors, even in areas of otherwise dense vegetation. The branches, if broken, ooze a translucent purple, viscous fluid that smells vaguely of citrus. The wax burns cleanly and evenly making it a good alternative to beeswax, and alchemists often seek it out as a foundation for magical glues and thickeners. Exceptionally skilled alchemists are able to use this wax to create a putty that can *permanently* change the shape and structure of facial features. The would-be master of disguise should be cautious however as minor, even accidental, tweaks to this formula will create a putty that causes organic matter (like faces) to dissolve and melt away in a matter of seconds.',

Another speaks of a powerful druid sacrificing herself to save the forest, and her ghost lives on within the branches of the weeping trees.

Each seed has a small petal, which is shaped in such a way that when it falls it creates a sound similar to a person softly crying.

This smoke acts as a potent anesthetic to exposed flesh, and the Lizardfolk are known to fill tents and lodges with it for both medical and spiritual reasons.

The roots of the bush are often exposed to the air, and are a favored nest'ing place for snakes and small vermin. Legend has it that the goddess Wa'il was once walking through the forest, draped in a fine robe made of dreams and sewn with threads of silver. Passing along, the robe was caught by a par'ticular bush, tearing the robe and causing it to spill dreams into the wind. Becoming angered by the act'ion, and the loss of dreams, Wa'il cursed the bush, causing it to transform into a twisted mockery of what it once was, and to be covered in thorns. However, the dream-related magic surrounding the plant remains. Consumption of the leaves in a pale tea leads to vivid and guiding dreams for 1d4 days afterward.",

While the trunk and branches are extremely dark, the leaves of the tree are pale grey and white, often giving the branches an appearance of glowing in the moonlight. The trees are often harvested for their precious darkwood, which has the sturdiness of other hard woods, but is favored because it only weighs half as much. Darkwood weapons and shields are often very light and worked only by the most skilled of craftsmen, both propert'ies that cause such goods to be quite expensive. Wizards of the South favor darkwood when construct'ing rods, wands, and staves (shields made of darkwood grant +2 AC and +1 to stealth checks made while holding the shield).
